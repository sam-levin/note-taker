# Note Taker App

## Description
This is a note-taker app using node.js and express to take and store notes, built as a project for the UCB-Bootcamp. The frontend allows the user to take notes with a title and text, and those can be stored using a POST request. When the page is re-opened, a GET request occurs which brings back the exisiting notes from the JSON file and puts them into HTML format on the page.
